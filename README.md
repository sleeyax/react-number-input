Fork of [chakra-ui/number-input@2.0.6](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/tree/main/packages/number-input), but fully self-contained and stripped from any external Chakra UI dependencies. Bring your own batteries, because no pre-built components are included either.

```sh
$ npm i @sleeyax/react-number-input
```
